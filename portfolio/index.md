## Work at [**SapientNitro**](http://www.sapient.com/en-us/sapientnitro.html)

I am still inquiring as to whether or not I can disclose the identity of the clients and projects I've worked on. For now I will say that I've developed for a wide array of clients, ranging from large international retailers to international financial institutions. Projects have included:

- **e-commerce site redesigns**
- **responsive site development**
- **custom physics implementations** in JavaScript for games
- **custom javascript architecture solutions**
- **highly interactive user experiences** on desktop browsers and mobile

## Side Projects

Please feel free to browse around my **[github account](https://github.com/wellcaffeinated)** for some **code samples**. In particular, I am currently developing a [**JavaScript physics engine** called *pQuery*](https://github.com/wellcaffeinated/pQuery). In addition to that I have completed the following projects:

### [Sheep Bounce](http://minutephysics.github.com/Sheep-Bounce/)

[![Sheep Bounce](/images/sheepbounce.gif)](http://minutephysics.github.com/Sheep-Bounce/)

After seeing the silly, yet addictive website, [cat-bounce.com](http://cat-bounce.com), I decided to quickly remix the idea - *For Science*! Using artwork created by [Henry Reich](http://minutephysics.com), I created a small web app that allows users to play around with sheep that bounce around the screen. The sheep resemble how atoms might jiggle around in an ideal gas, so I used that as the beginning of a conversation about physics, which leads the user to an instructional MinutePhysics video.

This app was created with HTML5 Canvas, Box2D (with boxbox), twitter Bootstrap, requirejs, and Yeoman (for dependency management).

### [YouTube Subtitle Explorer](/projects/youtube-subtitle-explorer)

[![YouTube Subtitle Explorer](http://content.screencast.com/users/jpalfr/folders/Jing/media/0f749363-70e4-46eb-9787-3d5561b58cfd/00000146.png)](/projects/youtube-subtitle-explorer)

With creative input from [Henry Reich of MinutePhysics](http://minutephysics.com) I designed and developed the [YouTube Subtitle Explorer](/projects/youtube-subtitle-explorer), an open-source project that facilitates crowdsourcing the translation of YouTube video subtitles. It was developed primarily with the [Silex PHP Microframework](http://silex.sensiolabs.org), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html), and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org). It provides users and administrators with a large array of features, including: caption submission moderation, batch approval of captions that are automatically uploaded to YouTube, google OpenID authentication, automatic updates, etc...

### [University of Toronto Swing Dance Club](http://ut-swing.info)

[![UT-Swing website redesign](http://content.screencast.com/users/jpalfr/folders/Jing/media/c5453262-762e-4a84-87e1-0554f1b56b42/00000126.png) **Full site redesign** for the *University of Toronto Swing Dance Club (UT-Swing)*](http://ut-swing.info). 

I independently completed the **design** and **development**. The implementation involved custom [wordpress](http://wordpress.org) template development, full responsive design, custom wordpress plugin development for linking live content with twitter.

### WellCaffeinated.net

**Full design and development of WellCaffeinated.net (this website)**. 

I've implemented a fully responsive design, using a custom implementation of [Wolf CMS](http://wolfcms.org) to use the [TWIG templating system](http://twig.sensiolabs.org). The front-end uses [requireJS](http://requirejs.org) for asynchronous javascript module loading. (Note: I have chosen not to support Internet Explorer 7, and minimally support Internet Explorer 8, although I have extensive experience developing for both of these browsers too).
