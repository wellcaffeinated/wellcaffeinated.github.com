I'd just like to announce that [ChallengePost is hosting a PhysicsJS contest][challenge]!

[![Register for the PhysicsJS Challenge](http://wellcaffeinated.net/images/physics-js-promo-widget.gif)][challenge]

I've also [created a tutorial][tutorial] to help people understand how to create
custom renderers with PhysicsJS. Better renderers are sorely needed to make PhysicsJS
even easier to use. I'm hoping some clever devs out there will be able to build
PhysicsJS renderers on top of great canvas libraries like
[KineticJS][kineticjs], [TWO.js][twojs], [Pixi.js][pixijs], [Paper.js][paperjs], or [Easel.js][easeljs].

I raise my coffee cup to you, Internet! Don't let me down!
