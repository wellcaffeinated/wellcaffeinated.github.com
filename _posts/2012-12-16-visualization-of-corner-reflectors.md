I recently made [a little visualization](http://wellcaffeinated.github.com/Optics/corner-reflector) to compliment the video about corner reflectors by Henry ([MinutePhysics](http://minutephysics.com/)) and Destin ([Smarter Every Day](http://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2)). It took me around 6 hours -- mostly thinking time -- using [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/). You can [visit the full version (and watch the video)](http://wellcaffeinated.github.com/Optics/corner-reflector), or play with this embedded version. Enjoy :)
