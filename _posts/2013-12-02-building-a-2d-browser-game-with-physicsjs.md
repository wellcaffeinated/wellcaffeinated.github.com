You might have heard a little while ago that I created a javascript physics engine called
[PhysicsJS](http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS). Turns out it's been getting a lot of
attention, but I'm behind on the documentation. I'm working on it though! I recently
published a tutorial as a guest blog on **flippin' awesome**;
[Building a 2D Asteroids Game with PhysicsJS][article].

> As a web developer and a physics geek, I always felt like something was lacking whenever 
> I tried to do 2D physics in JavaScript. I wanted an extensible framework that followed 
> in the footsteps of other modern JavaScript APIs. I didn’t want it to assume that I wanted 
> gravity to point downwards, or that I wanted gravity at all… That’s why I was driven to 
> create PhysicsJS, which I hope will live up to its tagline:
>
> > A modular, extendable, and easy-to-use physics engine for JavaScript.
