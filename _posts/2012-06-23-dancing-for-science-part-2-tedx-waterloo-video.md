Ever since we [danced at TEDx Waterloo](/articles/swing-dancing-for-science-at-tedx-waterloo), I've been waiting for the video to get onto youtube. Especially since there were apparently technical difficulties with the live stream, and many friends weren't able to see us dance. Fortunately, it's finally here! (I'm especially pleased with how they've edited "Classical Physics" into the video).
