Amidst the craziness that is "work", I have managed to find the time, not only to build one website (this one), but TWO! Behold, [The Ten Secular Commandments](http://thetensecularcommandments.com). It's still in the works, but it's there, and functional.

## Why?

Well, it started when I heard about the *Richard Dawkins Foundation* [Social Media Contest](http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644208)... or Video Contest... I don't know what they're officially calling it. The idea came after seeing one of the [promotional videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuUPnmooro), which described the contest as an effort to come up with a new version of the Ten Commandments. So I thought, *who am I to develop ten commandments that govern anybody?* It makes much more sense that these commandments be constructed collaboratively -- this is the "age of the interface" after all. So it seemed natural that I use one of my primary skills to help... web development.

Quoting from the *about* section of the website,

>The Ten Secular Commandments is a living document, giving the free-thinking community a forum for creating moral guidelines that draws on mankind's 
>greatest innovation: the scientific method. It allows people to collaboratively suggest, discuss, and continually tweak a set of commandments so as to 
>create a moral framework that isnâ€™t derived from doctrine.
>
>These commandments can change, as new evidence is uncovered about the human condition and how best to maximize well-being.
>
>They are participatory, obliging no one to be governed by any rules they could not help create.
>
>They are peer-reviewed. Users can make critiques, suggest modifications, or recommend/disagree with posts and suggested commandments submitted by others.
>
>They will not be policed. We hope that a framework will emerge that is generally appealing to everyone to follow.

It would be nice to win... but I more hope the website gets used and proves to be a productive effort for a cause I care about.
